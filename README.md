* Hide stories
* Disable audio autoplay on volume button press
* Remove sponsored messages*
* Allow message forwarding from anywhere*
* Override account limit*
* Force local 'Premium'* (for experiments only, doesn't do anything for server-side features)
* Force keep deleted messages* (extremely buggy, not supposed to be used like AyuGram or others)

\* - Potentially breaking Telegram's ToS, be careful!
