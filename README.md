# Killergram Neo
A successor to [Killergram](https://github.com/shatyuka/Killergram) by shatyuka.

An Xposed module aimed to enhance Telegram and it's forks without needing to modify the original app.

## Features
* Replace in-app icons with the Solar pack by [@Design480](https://t.me/Design480)
* Hide stories
* Remove sponsored messages*
* Allow message forwarding from anywhere*
* Override account limit*
* Force local 'Premium'* (for experiments only)

\* - *These features are potentially breaking Telegram's [ToS](https://telegram.org/tos), be careful when using them.*

## Supported cliens
In theory: Any client that is a fork of the official Telegram app.

Has been tested on:
* **Vanilla Telegram** (org.telegram.messenger)
* **exteraGram** (com.exteragram.messenger)
* **Cherrygram** (uz.unnarsx.cherrygram)

**Note:** The module doesn't and and will NOT work on Telegram X and it's forks.
